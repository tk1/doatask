# What is Doatask?

::: warning WARNING

Doatask is currently in 0.x status. It is already suitable for out-of-the-box
use, but is subject to changes.

:::


## Motivation

We want to offer a sophisticated online learning experience.

## Overview

Doatask is a tool that teachers can use to define tasks for their students.
These tasks can be combined into assignments. The students are to solve the
tasks. The system automatically evaluates and grades the solution. The students
are assigned a rating number that increases as the knowledge of the students
increases.

Doatask can operate as a external tool provider for learning platforms such as
[Moodle](https://moodle.org). The platform must comply to Learning Tools
Interoperability 1.3 (LTI).

> The IMS Learning Tools Interoperability® (LTI®) specification allows Learning
> Management Systems (LMS) or platforms to integrate remote tools and content in
> a standard way. [ref](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/)

Doatask has a plugin system. A plugin offers one or more task types. This means
that the system is not fixed to certain task types, but can be extended
dynamically.
