These tasks can be combined into assignments. The students are to solve the tasks. The system automatically evaluates and grades the solution. The students are assigned a rating number that increases as the knowledge of the students increases.</p><p>Doatask can operate as a external tool provider for learning platforms such as <a href="https://moodle.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moodle</a>. The platform must comply to Learning Tools Interoperability 1.3 (LTI).</p><blockquote><p>The IMS Learning Tools Interoperability\xAE (LTI\xAE) specification allows Learning Management Systems (LMS) or platforms to integrate remote tools and content in a standard way. <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a></p></blockquote><p>Doatask has a plugin system. A plugin offers one or more task types.
